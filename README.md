# 1. **From Perceptrons to Deep Learning: Nobel Prize for Hopfield and Hinton** 

*Marcin Wolter*

*5 November 2024*

Seminar presents the contributions of John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton to machine learning, leading to their Nobel Prize win in 2024. The neural network evolution from Rosenblatt's perceptron to deep learning is shown, highlighting milestones like Hopfield networks, backpropagation, and Boltzmann machines.

It includes practical examples of various ML algorithms, which led to the Nobel Prize in 2024. Slides prepared in the form of executable iPython notebook will be available at https://github.com/marcinwolter/Seminars/blob/main/Seminarium_2024_11_05.ipynb .

You are encouraged to bring your laptops!
